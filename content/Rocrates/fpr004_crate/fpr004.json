  "abstract": "Data access statements (DAS), also known as data availability statements, are key elements that can be used in multiple diverse disciplines and have a huge impact in providing essential information as it outlines where and how any underlying data may be accessed and reused, listing specific restrictions (if any) and the authorization process. It is therefore integral to the FAIRification process. Join us in this talk to discover how an effective data access statement should look like!\n Speakers: Juliane Schneider & Chris Erdmann ",

    "We need everyoneâ€™s help advancing data/software sharing policies, requirements, guidance (e.g., societies, publishers)",
"Institutions/disciplinary services need to work together to help simplify workflows for authors (e.g., help desk, repositories) ",
"We, the community, need to find better ways to integrate data/software best practices earlier in the research process, embed in research workflows (e.g, platforms, notebooks)",
"Researchers are inundated with guidance, we need to streamline information as much as possible in combination with the point above (e.g, checklists)",
"We need to demonstrate to researchers the value of sharing data/software by leveraging metadata (e.g., filtering, indexing)",
"Data access statements should include: Description of research output in manuscript, Location and link of repo, Description of repository/funder, Conditions for access and use with link to instructions, Data DOI"
