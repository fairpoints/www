    "FAIR-Jargon; in your opinion, which terms, concepts and/or phrases commonly used in FAIR discussions that need more definition?",
    "“Accessible” it gets confused with ‘open’, could also means “electronic accessibility” for the differently abled community, e.g. those with sight, hearing impairments.",
    "Interoperable - not one of the most common words in English and a difficult concept which doesn’t really help.",
    "fuzzy distinction between interoperable and reusable in common usage",

    "Researchers are afraid of being scooped and don't understand licensing and ownership as well as how to choose conditions in publishing in repos",
    "Alot of metadata is expected, adding a level of effort in curation, labor intensive process which can be made easier if researchers provide accurate and detailed information from the start",
