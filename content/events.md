### Enhancing Sample Provenance and Experimental Reproducibility
Lack of reliable information about sample usage, location, provenance, metadata and experimental use is a core barrier to experimental reproducibility and general FAIRification of data.  This presentation will describe how these issues are being addressed in the design and development of a sample management module within the RSpace electronic lab notebook, focusing on three specific challenges: (1) Incorporating sample data into experimental documentation; (2) Associating PIDS like IGSNs and RRIDS into sample metadata; and (3) Export of sample metadata in required formats to different domain repositories and databases.

### Things you need to know about Data Access Statements
Data access statements (DAS), also known as data availability statements, are key elements that can be used in multiple diverse disciplines and have a huge impact in providing essential information as it outlines where and how any underlying data may be accessed and reused, listing specific restrictions (if any) and the authorization process. It is therefore integral to the FAIRification process. Join us in this talk to discover how an effective data access statement should look like!

### Harmonising FAIR data sharing with Legal Compliance
FAIR mechanisms have pioneered a new paradigm of making data discoverable, accessible, and reusable. At the same time, a new wave of privacy and data protection laws (including GDPR) around the world is regulating how personal data is shared responsibly. This talk explores the intersection between the two communities and discusses how each can help the other. In particular, it focuses on how we can utilise FAIR metadata and mechanisms to ensure data is shared and used legally while also increasing its reusability. Conversely, it also takes a look at what FAIR principles can do for improving how we deal with legal compliance.

### Step by Step Publishing with ResearchEquals
In this talk, we will explore the open source publishing platform [ResearchEquals](https://www.researchequals.com/), where you can publish your entire research journey, step by step. With this, researchers get the autonomy to make all their research outputs findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. In this presentation, Chris Hartgerink shows how you can get started with this new publishing system and how you can help shape its future development.
