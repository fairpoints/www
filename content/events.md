### Harmonising FAIR data sharing with Legal Compliance
FAIR mechanisms have pioneered a new paradigm of making data discoverable, accessible, and reusable. At the same time, a new wave of privacy and data protection laws (including GDPR) around the world is regulating how personal data is shared responsibly. This talk explores the intersection between the two communities and discusses how each can help the other. In particular, it focuses on how we can utilise FAIR metadata and mechanisms to ensure data is shared and used legally while also increasing its reusability. Conversely, it also takes a look at what FAIR principles can do for improving how we deal with legal compliance.

### Things you need to know about Data Access Statements
Data access statements (DAS), also known as data availability statements, are key elements that can be used in multiple diverse disciplines and have a huge impact in providing essential information as it outlines where and how any underlying data may be accessed and reused, listing specific restrictions (if any) and the authorization process. 

It is therefore integral to the FAIRification process. 

Join us in this talk to discover how an effective data access statement should look like!
