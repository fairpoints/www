### Harmonising FAIR data sharing with Legal Compliance
FAIR mechanisms have pioneered a new paradigm of making data discoverable, accessible, and reusable. At the same time, a new wave of privacy and data protection laws (including GDPR) around the world is regulating how personal data is shared responsibly. This talk explores the intersection between the two communities and discusses how each can help the other. In particular, it focuses on how we can utilise FAIR metadata and mechanisms to ensure data is shared and used legally while also increasing its reusability. Conversely, it also takes a look at what FAIR principles can do for improving how we deal with legal compliance.
